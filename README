This is the data used for the following study:

Folders are organized in BIDS format. 
Within each subject folder (e.g. /sub-01/) there are subfolders with the following:

Ses-first/
a) beh - Behavioral results from first session outside the scanner conditioning (event.tsv) 
- Instrumental conditioning
- Pavlovian Conditioning
- Hedonic evaluation of stimuli 

ses-second/
1) anat - structural whole brain T1-weighted (T1w) images (isotropic voxel size = 1.0 mm) defaced & whole brain reference functional image (WBref or sbref)

2) func - contains the raw BOLD timeseries (26 partial oblique axial T2*weighted EPI) with its associated behavioral data (event.tsv) used for the analysis.
- PIT task, with odors as stimuli and uses a hand dynamo-meter to measure mobilized effort.
- HEDONIC task, with odors as stimuli and uses visual analog scales to measure subjective liking and intensity ratings.

3) fmap - Dual gradient B0 field maps (Fmaps)

Please note that these you can find the preprocessed functional MRI data (smoothed and unsmoothed) used for the analysis into the /DERIVATIVES/PREPROC/  sub-folder.

Also note that not all participants finished all tasks, or scans. 

See paper for a description.
